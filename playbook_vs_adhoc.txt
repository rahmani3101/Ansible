# Playbook vs Ad-hoc Commands in Ansible

## Playbooks
- Declarative configuration management
- Repeatable and consistent
- Complex, multi-step automation
- Stored as YAML files
- Version controlled
- Example: Full Nginx installation with configuration

## Ad-hoc Commands
- Quick, one-time operations
- Immediate execution
- Simple, single-task operations
- Executed directly from command line
- No persistent configuration
- Example: Restart Nginx service instantly

## Key Differences
1. Complexity: 
   - Playbook: High (multi-step processes)
   - Ad-hoc: Low (single commands)

2. Reusability:
   - Playbook: High (can be reused)
   - Ad-hoc: Low (one-time use)

3. Configuration Management:
   - Playbook: Comprehensive
   - Ad-hoc: Limited

## Example Comparison
Playbook: 
```yaml
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install and configure Nginx
      # Multiple steps
```

Ad-hoc:
```bash
ansible webservers -m service -a "name=nginx state=restarted"
```
